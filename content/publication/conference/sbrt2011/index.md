abstract: "In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to restore calls upon a single failure in transparent optical net- works. After a failure, the proposed algorithm performs a path restoration searching for the route which presents the higher optical signal-to-noise ratio. We compared our proposal to three other well known approaches in the literature. We achieved lower failure rates in the restoration process for three different scenarios."
