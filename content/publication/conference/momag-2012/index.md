abstract: "We propose a novel policy to select the route for an adaptive-alternative routing algorithm for all-optical networks, named NrPSR(OSNR). We use the NrPSR to finds the Nr routes with lower cost for a given source-destination pair according to a cost function expanded in a power series (PSR) in which the coefficients are determined by a Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO). The selected route to attend to the call request is chosen among the Nr found routes depending on a OSNR based policy. In our simulations we considered some physical layer effects, such as: ASE noise generation, Optical Amplifier gain and ASE saturation and OXC crosstalk. We compared the performance of our algorithm through simulation to others previous proposed policies of NrPSR and other well known algorithms described in the literature. Our proposal outperformed all the other routing algorithms."
