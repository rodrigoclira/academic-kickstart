abstract: "Constant technological advances have made society face the needto acquire new skills, one of which is programming. At first, thisactivity was aimed only at computer professionals, but it arousededucators’ interest and has been incorporated as part of the schoolcurriculum. Therefore, some initiatives try to present programmingto children using different approaches. Our proposal focuses onprogramming using robotics. The work shows the development ofa robot created with Arduino to be used in an educational game.In the proposal, the player needs to develop the robot’s algorithmto move to a goal on the map in the game. An Android applicationcontrols the robot, and the whole proposal is created in a playfulmanner. Thus, it is expected to create a low-cost tool to stimulatecomputational thinking."
