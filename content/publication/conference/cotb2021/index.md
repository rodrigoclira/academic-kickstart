abstract: "Constant technological advances have made society face the need to acquire new skills, one of which is programming. At first, this activity was aimed only at computer professionals, but it arousededucators’ interest and has been incorporated as part of the school curriculum. Therefore, some initiatives try to present programming to children using different approaches. Our proposal focuses on programming using robotics. The work shows the development of a robot created with Arduino to be used in an educational game.In the proposal, the player needs to develop the robot’s algorithm to move to a goal on the map in the game. An Android application controls the robot, and the whole proposal is created in a playful manner. Thus, it is expected to create a low-cost tool to stimulate computational thinking."
